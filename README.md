# React + Vite

Project Briefing:
In line with the subjects that freelancers in our system are specialized in, customers can receive services in many sub-categories such as language training, design services, legal consultancy, including the main categories of consultancy, training and freelancing through freelancers, and can also benefit from numerous services provided through collective interviews, conferences and publications. Bidabi, which supports this system online with the Zoom application, one-to-one or collectively, via broadcasting or messaging, ensures customer satisfaction with its extra features (specified in the Features section).


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
